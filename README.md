# WASM-Analyzer
## Crawler
### NPM-Crawling via Docker
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Docker and Docker-Compose https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
3. Run `nx run crawler:build:production` to build the crawler.
4. Run `docker-compose up --no build` to start the couchdb.
5. Open CouchDB dashboard http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils.
6. Create a new database.
7. Set the permissions of the database to public (remove the admin and member roles).
8. Create a new replication with the remote source https://skimdb.npmjs.com/registry and the previously created
   database as target. Authentication for the local database may be required.
9. The npm database should now be starting to replicate. This may take a while. To stop the replication remove the
   replication document.
10. Run `docker-compose build wasm-crawler` to build the image of the crawler. To start the crawler run
    `docker-compose up wasm-crawler`. The crawler will now start to crawl the database. The crawled files will be
    stored in the directory defined in the volumes section of the wasm-crawler service in the docker-compose.yml.

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve my-monorepo`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
